## Short-Term Goals (Next 1–2 Months)

### 1. Enhanced Task Management
- **Subtasks**  
  - Allow users to break a main task into smaller, checkable subtasks.
  - Visual progress indicator (e.g., progress bar) on the parent task card.
- **Recurring Tasks**  
  - Enable creation of daily, weekly, or custom recurrence patterns.
  - Auto-generate recurring tasks in the calendar view.
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**  
  - Implement drag-and-drop for manual ordering of tasks within a list.
  - Persist order in user’s profile (so it’s consistent across sessions).

### 2. Improved Goal-Tracking UX
- **Milestones & Checkpoints**  
  - Let users define intermediate milestones for long-term goals.
  - Progress chart that visualizes percentage completion of each goal.
- **Goal-Completion Celebrations**  
  - Confetti or simple animation when a goal is marked as completed.
  - “Congrats” modal with option to share achievement on social media.

### 3. Basic Analytics & Insights
- **Weekly Summary Emails**  
  - Send users a summary of tasks completed, pending tasks, and goal progress.
  - Include motivational tips based on user activity (e.g., “You completed 80% of your weekly tasks!”).
- **In-App Statistics Panel**  
  - Display charts (bar or line) showing tasks completed per week/month.
  - Show streaks (e.g., days in a row with ≥1 completed task).

### 4. Performance & Reliability
- **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**  
  - Optimize component loading to minimize initial bundle size.
  - Ensure sub-pages load quickly, even on slower connections.
- **Automated Testing Suite**  
  - Unit tests for critical components (task list, goal creation form).
  - Integration tests for authentication flow.
  - CI/CD pipeline integration (e.g., GitHub Actions → Vercel preview deployments).

## Mid-Term Goals (Next 3–6 Months)

### 1. Collaboration & Sharing
- **Shared Goals & Tasks**  
  - Users can invite others to collaborate on a specific goal or task list.
  - Set permissions (e.g., “View only,” “Comment,” “Edit”).
- **Public Goal Templates**  
  - Introduce a template library where users can browse and import common goal templates (e.g., “30-Day Fitness Challenge,” “Semester Study Schedule”).
  - Allow community submission of templates (pending moderation).

### 2. Calendar & Time Management
- **Full Calendar Integration**  
  - Display tasks with due dates directly in a month/week/day calendar view.
  - Sync with popular external calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook) via API.
- **Time-Blocking Mode**  
  - Let users assign estimated durations to tasks and block out time slots in calendar.
  - Visual “time-blocked” UI to help users allocate daily/weekly schedules.

### 3. Advanced Analytics & AI-Powered Insights
- **Trend Analysis Dashboard**  
  - Show task completion trends over time, broken down by category.
  - Highlight “productive hours” based on when the user completes most tasks.
- **AI-Driven Suggestions**  
  - Provide smart suggestions for task prioritization based on user history.
  - Predictive nudges (e.g., “You’re likely to miss this goal; consider adjusting your deadline.”).

### 4. Mobile App Prototype (React Native)
- **Cross-Platform Support**  
  - Build a minimal viable mobile app using React Native for iOS and Android.
  - Sync realtime data with the web app backend.
- **Offline Mode**  
  - Enable local persistence of tasks/goals when the user is offline.
  - Automatic sync once connectivity is restored.

## Long-Term Goals (6–12 Months and Beyond)

### 1. Gamification & Rewards
- **Points & Badges System**  
  - Award points for completing tasks on time, hitting streaks, and achieving milestones.
  - Badge library (e.g., “Task Master,” “Consistency King/Queen,” “Early Bird”).
- **Leaderboard & Community Challenges**  
  - Optionally opt into community challenges (e.g., “Complete 50 tasks in May”).
  - Anonymous leaderboard showcasing top performers.

### 2. Third-Party Integrations & Plugins
- **Zapier / IFTTT Integration**  
  - Automate workflows (e.g., “New task created → post to Slack channel”).
  - Prebuilt “Zaps” and “Applets” for popular services (Trello, Asana, Slack).
- **Browser Extension**  
  - Quick-add tasks directly from any website or web app.
  - Popup shows a minimal UI: “Title,” “Due Date,” “Category,” “Add to Material Goals.”

### 3. Enterprise & Team-Focused Offering
- **Team Workspaces**  
  - Shared organization account for companies, startups, and large teams.
  - Team-level analytics: overall productivity, project timelines, resource allocation.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  - Admins, managers, and members with different permission levels.
  - Audit logs and activity history for compliance and reporting.

### 4. White-Label & Custom Branding

  - Dependency updates and patching (e.g., React, Material 3, Node.js).
- **Accessibility Compliance**  
  - WCAG 2.1 AA standards audit.
  - Screen-reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, high-contrast mode.
